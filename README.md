# Boost-Control
Control System for a Kick Circuit

## Stage 1: Model
Once the Cubesat was built, the dynamic response of the system was modeled in Laplace using MATLAB

## Stage 2:  PID Control
Design and simulation of the Digital Controller (in the z plane)

## Stage 3: Results
Comparison of the simulated response with the experimental result + slide presentation of the project
