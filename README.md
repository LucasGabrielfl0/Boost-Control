# Boost-Control [CHANGE NAME]
Control System for a Kick Circuit 

## Stage 1: Model & Circuit Validation
To validate the electronic circuit, a simulation was created using LTspice

IMAGEM LTSPICE

## Stage 2: Control Simulation
The discrete control system was tested using matlab
IMAGEM MATLAB

## Stage 3: Results
Comparison of the simulated response with the experimental result + slide presentation of the project

## Digital Controller
Finally, the discrete controller was implemented using an ESP32
